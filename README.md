# Dynamic & Interactive A* Visualizer

---
A simple A* Visualizer written in Python where the user can define a start & end point and create obstacles and see a visualization of the A* algorithm trying to find the optimal path from start to finish. I built this project to learn how to implement A* algorithm in a real world scenario and to learn the basics of building GUIs in the Python `tkinter` library.
